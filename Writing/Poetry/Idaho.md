# Idaho 

La vérité  
At first light, our oldest gets on the school bus  
I begin work at the table  
My wife begins her chores  
I used to go mountain biking. After her class  
Now, we could go mountain biking  
Not here. School schedules  
Flat without public land  
Businesses and houses  
Endless development suffocates nature  
The youngest awakes. We have cappuccino  
I finish the paper  
She finishes her chores  
Time to drive the youngest to school  
Do I run today? What day of the week is it?  
She goes to class  
I wait. Times differ  
I go to swim class  
I am the youngest by an entire generation  
An older gentlemen knew Patton's protege  
She waits. Times differ  
Shower. Get into the home office  
I won't talk with anyone until the next swim class  
If I do not run, I won't leave the house  
My wife leaves. Errands  
She hates the amount of people  
The noise  
The endless development  
Days go by  
I see if anyone wants to grab a beer  
Friday after work.  
At lunch  
Anytime  
They never do. I stopped asking  
She does not have anyone to ask  
Our lifestyle differ  
Our goals differ  
We cannot relate  
To anyone  
The oldest is home. Homework  
She has played for fifteen minutes today  
Her life mimics mine  
Such a young age to be trapped in the cycle  
She waits for her sister  
This is not a life for a child  
The youngest is home. Same situation  
The weekend has arrived. No one has responded or reached out  
We are living a life we never wanted  
We wanted a life of adventure, a life of exploration  
We are too young to ideally sit  

To ideally live here.  
Those past opportunities, were for me, not us.  
They were unfair to her.  
To the girls.  
We built our lifestyle.  
We defined our life.  
Life free of constraints.  
Life free of conformity.  
Life free.  
Work does not define me.  
Does not define us.  
But how will the girls define me?  
How will they define us?  
In the next decade.  
We will roam with the girls.  
Roam through the back country.  
Through the Alaskan wilderness.  
Over a fortnight.  
We will cover a 100 miles.  
Catch a portion of our rations.  
We will move. To Idaho Falls. This summer.  
We are not planning beyond that.  
This is our goal. 
A goal for for me.  
A goal for our girls.  
A goal for our family.  
Our vision.  
What does it take?  
To raise girls capable of such an expedition?  
You will find us high in the mountains.  
Next to a clear river.  
Sleeping in a tent.
