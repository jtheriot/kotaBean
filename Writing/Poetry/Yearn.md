# Yearn

Yearning, a constant desire  
A burning, never content  
Hellbent, on finding meaning  
Peace, a release from society  
The norms, direction, perplexed 
on the migration of time  
I remain confined, to my mind 
Pious to Augustine, oppose my faith  
Wait for Zion, conversion  
Yield to the yearning
