# Fog

Early morning fog are low clouds  
Low clouds are fog in the late night  
Fog envelopes the woods  
Acting as the canopy  
As the sky  
The canopy  
The sky  
Shadows of trees in the fog  
Fog  
The moisture  
A beard softens  
Over a jog  
In low clouds  
Drops of water  
In a beard  
The fog  
Droplets fall  
Rain  
Too heavy  
For the edges
