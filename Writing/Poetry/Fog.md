# Fog

Early morning fog are low clouds  
Low clouds are fog in the late night  
Fog envelopes the woods, a canopy   
The canopy, the sky  
The sky, shadows of trees in the fog  
Fog, the moisture softens a beard 
Over a jog in low clouds  
Drops of water in a beard  
The fog droplets fall, the rain  
Too heavy for the edges
