# Knots

How shall I use my time? Measure time?

At one knot, life is mine to choose.
The ability to pursue passion.
Yet, unable to determine that passion.
Though capable of the discipline required to find,
see that passion out.

Until then,  
I will not cut my beard,  
Until I have found the path,  
my direction.  

How many knots?
