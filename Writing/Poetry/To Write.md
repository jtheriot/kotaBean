# To Write

I write to understand.

In my words. In my sentences. In my paragraphs. Within my pages.

The continuous attempt to bring meaning to life beyond the abstract.

Life beyond the nihilistic outlook our generation forces up the next.

The answers are hidden even to me.

Answers found between the lines I have written. Answers found between the lines I will write. Answers found in lines that have remained as thoughts.

Thoughts are written to understand.
