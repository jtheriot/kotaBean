A mon amour \\!

I ponder \\
How whiskey afflicted \\
Ulysses S. Grant \\
I ponder \\
As the herb burns \\
The affliction \\
From me on \\
My life \\
Our life \\!

So I write \\
A letter \\
For me \\
For you \\
This letter \\!

Fourteen years \\ 
Of marriage \\
As childhood  \\
Became adulthood \\
Years shaping \\
Our present \\
Choices \\
On survival \\
In hope for \\
A better future \\
A future never dreamt \\!

We were told \\
When to live \\
Where to live \\
Our jobs \\
The time \\
To arrive \\
To leave \\
The time  \\
We will be away \\
Life constrained \\!

But life  \\
Life must be \\ 
Unconstrained \\
Our discretion \\
Life is free \\
Life is \\!

How do we live \\
Live free \\
Free to choose \\
Free of time \\!

As a father \\ 
How do I lead \\
Our children \\
In the use of time \\!

As a father \\
I must reveal \\
The wilderness \\
The being \\
In being \\
The soul \\!

As a man \\
I must set \\
A goal for \\
Myself \\
Our family \\
The girls \\!

A mindset \\
A lifestyle \\
A way of life \\
A goal \\!

A goal \\
To trek  \\
For fourteen days \\ 
Through Alaskan wilderness \\
We will cover \\
One hundred miles \\
Catch fish \\
Be responsible \\ 
Our gear \\
Our survival \\
Be Reliant \\
On ourselves \\
On each other \\
For each other \\
We are a unit \\!

To know  \\
They can \\
I will test them \\
Academically \\
In remote locations \\!

I do this \\
To know \\
I write this \\ 
To know \\
To know  \\
The acumen  \\
Of raising daughters \\
Capable of dispute  \\
Over profound books \\
On difficult topics  \\
To know  \\
To know \\
The acumen \\
Of raising daughters  \\
Capable of  \\
Back country expedition \\
Hundreds of miles \\
Over a fortnight \\!

A clear objective \\
Our goal \\
To know \\
I leave them \\
Better than me  \\
Inspired to be me \\
To be better than me \\!

I write \\
My thoughts \\
I keep notes \\
On all \\!

They shall comprehend \\
Their capabilities \\
Forged  \\
In the wilderness \\!

I will be away \\
Alone \\
On a mountain \\
Next to a river \\
In a tent \\!

This is for me \\
This is for them \\
This if for us

\end{verse}
