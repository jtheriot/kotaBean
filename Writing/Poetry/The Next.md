A mon amour  

I ponder  
How whiskey afflicted  
Ulysses S. Grant  
I ponder  
As the herb burns  
The affliction  
From me on  
My life  
Our life  

So I write  
A letter  
For me  
For you  
This letter  

Fourteen years  
Of marriage  
As childhood  
Became adulthood  
Years shaping  
Our present  
Choices  
On survival  
In hope for  
A better future  
A future never dreamt  

We were told  
When to live  
Where to live  
Our jobs  
The time  
To arrive  
To leave  
The time  
We will be away  
Life constrained  

But life  
Life must be  
Unconstrained  
Our discretion  
Life is free  
Life is  

How do we live  
Live free  
Free to choose  
Free of time  

As a father  
How do I lead  
Our children  
In the use of time  

As a father  
I must reveal  
The wilderness  
The being  
In being  
The soul  

As a man  
I must set  
A goal for  
Myself  
Our family  
The girls  

A mindset
A lifestyle  
A way of life  
A goal  

A goal  
To trek  
For fourteen days  
Through Alaskan wilderness  
We will cover  
One hundred miles  
Catch fish  
Be responsible  
Our gear  
Our survival  
Be Reliant  
On ourselves  
On each other  
For each other  
We are a unit  

To know  
They can  
I will test them  
Academically  
In remote locations  

I do this  
To know  
I write this  
To know  
The acumen  
Of raising daughters  
Capable of dispute  
Over profound books  
On difficult topics  
To know  
To know  
The acumen  
Of raising daughters  
Capable of  
Back country expedition  
Hundreds of miles  
Over a fortnight  

A clear objective  
Our goal  
To know  
I leave them  
Better than me  
Inspired to be me  
To be better than me  

I write  
My thoughts  
I keep notes  
On all  

They shall comprehend  
Their capabilities  
Forged  
In the wilderness  

I will be away  
Alone  
On a mountain  
Next to a river  
In a tent  

This is for me  
This is for them  
This if for us
