Thirteen Year Plan
It is 2023, we’re 37.

Throughout my life, I have always sought an adventure. A grand vision that life would prove to be a tale plucked from the depths of Middle Earth. Those exist, but are mere moments, speaks of time, that we tell around dinner tables, and beers with friends. Most of time our spent in a routine. Seeing the same people at the same time at the same places. Humans are a habitual species.

Our habits have evolved into chaos. Consistently overbooked schedules with no fore thought to a year or two beyond the moment. My family’s library, small, around three-hundred books, contains in the moment purchases. Books, dense tombs of knowledge, requiring daily diligent work over a considerable amount of time to get through. 

We believe we are smart. Everyone believes they are above average. From an income perspective people would assume I held a some level of intelligence. My seventh grade daughter’s math homework has yet to stump me but later that day Quanta Magazine sent updated me about a sophomore, college but high school who knows, solving an ancient math problem using an obscure form of mathematics. 

It was said, that a man’s library is not what he knows but what he does not know. Though I wonder, that a man’s library accompanied by his thoughts, is what he knows.* If so, how long would it take? Thirteen years. 

What else? Became UltraStrong? Earned our Bush Pilot’s license. Are fluent in French, German, and Japanese or Russian. Had six notebooks full of writing. Traveled to twenty-five states, and six countries. Embraced our careers. 

Where will we be in thirteen years? I do not anticipate a special revelation, guarantee of happiness, or success. Just a life.

A life of memories conform to a period of thirteen years. A series of pursuits. A test in education. Everyone else is always the moron in the story but what do we actually know. How much can one person be informed on? Do any topics make me want to dive deeper into a specific topic? Do I even know enough? No. But lets see. 

What is the body capable of doing? Can you compete in an open Strongman competition one day? With stones, of course. Then the following day complete a 50 miler trail run. Is that possible? I wonder. 

That adventurous spirit. To fly a plane from a lake in Alaska through a mountain pass and land on a grass landing strip in the between the trees on the mouth of the bay. Or based on windsock in a field among fields. Nothing important. Enjoying the trip. 

The ability to communicate to ideas beyond your current linguistic capabilities. What does the language tell us? What does English tell us, about us? A previous generations language. French, and German. A romantic and Germanic. An entirely different language. Japanese or Russian?. 

Always document your thoughts. Keep most of them private, or among a small circle, sharing only those you have diligently thought out. Thoughts, sketches with the imagination that are spared from outside influence. Never stop. 

Embrace the challenge of a career. Deepen technological knowledge and understand how to drive business value. The two will satisfy that drive. Navigate and plan appropriately. A focused drive. 

Thirteen years. I give myself thirteen years. 

A period that will impact the remainder of our life. We are given seven to eight of these periods in a life. 

Our fourth period.

** To be considered UltraStrong. An individual must compete in a Strongman competition without zeroing any events in the open category on a Saturday. Immediately the next day, that Sunday, the individual must run an ultra-marathon, specifically, a 50 miler, preferably a single track trail run, under the allotted time.

*** Work, specifically my own domain, which is unique to everyone. Currently, mine is a data scientist for a start-up cyber-risk quantification company. Data science with experience and in a management role, lucrative. Cyber-security with experience, gaining penetration testing, publications, patents, lucrative. Combining the two one has to believe immensely lucrative. Given
