Thirteen Year Plan
It is 2023, I am 37. 

In our home, books are readily available, a range of topics, H.P Lovecraft’s complete work to de Carmo’s Reimannian Geometry and St. Agustine Confession’s to Bzenki and Huntington’s American Soviet Policy. Someone said, a man’s library is not what he knows, but what he does not know. This is true for me. Also a sign of my many delusions of grandeur I embrace while strolling a bookstore’s aisles.

Give or take some books, a home library should consist of the foundation of an adult education. The simplest manner for anyone to demonstrate competency is by reading, writing, and problem solving. Thus, all the books in our home library shall be read with a minimum of a quarter of the problems completed if required, with an accompanying essay minimum 1,000 words.


When you break your life into chunks of years, growth appears more easily. Memories, habits, your initial identity begins at thirteen, the formative years. The following thirteen years are of immense growth. Who were we at 13, 26, 39 and so forth? While I am at in between stage, I want to establish a plan built on long-term stability. Stable as one can be. 

My daughter will be turning 13 in a few months. What life and opportunities have we afforded her, both our daughters? Where will they be in at 26, and 23?

Personal plan involves becoming UltraStrong. A test of what the body is ultimately capable of. To be considered one. An individual must compete in a Strongman competition without zeroing any events in the open category on a Saturday. Immediately the next day, that Sunday, the individual must run an ultra-marathon, specifically, a 50 miler, preferably a single track trail run, under the allotted time.



Earn my Private Pilot’s VFR and Bush Pilot license. Become fluent in French, German, and Japanese or Russian. Have six notebooks full of writing. Travel to 25 states, and six countries. 

Privacy, the information light age. The spread and reaction of information. We have transitioned into this phase from the 1990s, some would argue before that. However, the 2010s fully exemplified the fundamental differences of having 24/7 connection to everyone, their entire lives at every moment, important events requiring additional journalism, research being published at a constant rate with an unknown reproducible rate. Even further detailed information about ourselves, connections we rarely make, are stored throughout the world. How do we proceed? 

I am unsure these goals will lead anywhere. To any special revelation, any guarantee on happiness, or success. You set the goal knowing the story unfolds during the journey.
