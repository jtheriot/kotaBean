Thirteen Year Plan
It is 2023, I am 37.

When you look back at life, you break it down into chunks. Chunks of days, weeks, months, decades. Or odd chunks of thirteen. A unit that allows choices in life to have lasting effects though enough time to rebound from losses. A person is given seven to eight chunks. 

For the fourth chunk, all the books in our home library shall be read, a minimum of a quarter of the problems completed if required, with an accompanying essay, minimum 1,000 words. Become UltraStrong*. Earn my Bush Pilot license. Fluent in French, German, and Japanese or Russian. Have six notebooks full of writing. Travel to 25 states, and six countries. Document the chunk. 

I do not anticipate a special revelation, guarantee of happiness, or success. I anticipate life.

* To be considered UltraStrong. An individual must compete in a Strongman competition without zeroing any events in the open category on a Saturday. Immediately the next day, that Sunday, the individual must run an ultra-marathon, specifically, a 50 miler, preferably a single track trail run, under the allotted time.
