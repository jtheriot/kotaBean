# Outlook

You can have nothing or everything in life. Your needs, wants, and desires meet though neglecting to feed your soul will drive you mad. The stagnation of ideas, the idleness, a life without purpose or reason is a life already dead, if not you will soon die. Without anything to grow in to we stop being. We must look back on time with a sense of peace in ourselves. 

Our purpose should be to build. Build a work of our thoughts. Build a lifestyle around a sustainable ecosystem. Build the family dynamic around our own established philosophy.
