# Peace

Man is meant to be free. Free to live as he sees. Free to work as sees. Free to trade as sees. His freedom, is to be.

In order to maintain freedom a man must have the ability to defend himself, his family, his land. His composure, his dignity must be upheld at all times, even as he defends.

In a free life, a man is not given direction. The direction falls solely on the free man. His character is demonstated by the direction he takes in the usage of his of time.

A man's passion, fear, and drive, determine his direction . A man without passion, fear or drive will never be at peace. A man finds peace when he understands himself. That peace provides his direction.  

Without direction a man will fail to grow. And without growth a man stops being.
