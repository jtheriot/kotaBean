I kissed your mother good-bye before going into the Adana airport terminal. She would drive back to Incirlik Air Base. You were three. Mom was still carrying you. You all would fly to Mobile the following day. Staying with grandma until the birth. I would fly there two months later. 

A year remained on my enlistment. A year of grad-school as well. Aspirations were high. International economic development, work with USAID, take the Foreign Service Officer exam to become a diplomat. I was on Turkish Airlines to Ankara then Doha. Followed by Qatar Airlines to Kathmandu. 

Someone said, a man’s library is not what he knows, but what he does not know. Or a sign of my delusions of grandeur I embrace while strolling a bookstore’s aisles. Our home embraces on a range topics, H.P Lovecraft’s complete works to de Carmo’s Reimannian Geometry and St. Agustine Confession’s to Bzenki and Huntington’s American Soviet Policy. Or home library should consist of the foundation of an adult education.
