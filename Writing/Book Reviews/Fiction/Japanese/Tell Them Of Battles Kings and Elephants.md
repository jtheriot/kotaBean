Life as a free man, deviods itself of direction. The choice of how to live, falls soley on the man. _What man wants without realizing it is for our fears to disappear, for healing, union, return, oblivion._ Regardless of the circumstance man is free to choose the direction he leads his life. Though how does man choose? The _power inside us devours us in solitude._

Removing all actions in which man harms another man through physical altercation we are left with a myrad of choices. Attempting to account for all indirect harm is a futile thought experiment. Eventually man believes life causes too much suffering, thus ending his own. _Men are children who chase away their despair with anger, their fear with love; they respond to the void by building castles and temples._ How does man proceed?

The question leads to philosophical purgatoury. As civilization are demanded man to excel in solving defined problems. Abstract problems in which answers shift have eluded us. _Bridges are beautiful things, so long as they last; everything will perish._ Enard's work will perish but the passion we find within stories question
