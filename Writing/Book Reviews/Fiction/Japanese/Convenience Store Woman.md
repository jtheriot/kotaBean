On the surface Murata's writes in an uncomplicated manner, painting a colorful depiction of Keiko's life as a Japanse conenvience store worker. Yet, _Convenience Store Woman_ provides an intimate portrayl of Keiko coming to terms with herself. In a brief flashback she remembers her training, the proper manner to tidy her uniform, the various phrases to be said in the store with the tone, pitch, and volume to be perfected. _Well done Miss Furukura, that was perfect!_ and on opening day she _actually became a normal cog in society._ 

After eighteen years Keiko reamins a loyal employee, pledging _to provide our customers with the best service and to aim to make our store the beloved store choice of the area._  As a reader you yearn for the pleasure Keiko find in her work. Her happiness. The interdependence between her co-workers, _frankfurters are on promotion today, so make sure you prepare enough of them. We are aiming to sell a hundred! I'm depending on you, Miss. Furukura._ Yet society belittles a woman in her thirties still working at a convenience store. As a former male collegue _put bluntly, your're the lowest or the low._ She understands _the normal world has no room for exceptions and always quietly eliminates foeign objects._ 

Even the strongest surmise to the constant berudging as Keiko invites a disgraced Shiraha to live with her. Thinking _it might actually be convenient for_ her to have him there. She calls her sister _to see what her reaction would be, and she immediately jumped to her own conculusion and was really happy for me._ Though as we often learn in our lives, our own happiness, pir own desires are what we must embrace. Regardless of the norms society places on us, we are not required follow them. Kieko _needs to hear the sound of the convenoence store_ as she is a _convenience store worker._

A standard tale, but smart, quirky, and told from the most unusal location, simply a joy to read. Irasshaimase, _Convenience Store Woman_!
