In Mathias Enard's _Tell Them of Battles, Kinds & Elephants_, Michelango Buonarrpti departs Rome for Constantinople to design a bridge over the Golden Horn for the Sultan. The ramifications if found out by the Pope would be sever, though we will dive into the historical aspects, we emphasize the choice to depart, was a choice he freely made. Enard yields a story on the struggle of passion, life, and choice. Life as a free man, devoids itself of direction. The choice on how to live, falls solely on the man. _What man wants without realizing it is for our fears to disappear, for healing, union, return, oblivion._ Regardless of the circumstance, man is free to choose the direction he leads his life.

But _men are children who chase away their despair with anger, their fear with love; they respond to the void by building castles and temples._ How does a man proceed? The question delves into philosophical purgatory but civilizations have demanded man to eclipse those before him solving defined problems where abstract problems in which answers shift have eluded us. _Bridges are beautiful things, so long as they last; everything will perish._

Enard's artistic work will perish but we continue to build. Build our passion, knowledge in the defined and abstract, so those who come after us, understand where they come from. A novella to drive us toward our own greatness.
